    <h3>A Little about Myself :)</h3>

    <p id = 'main'> My name is Liza Davitadze, and I am currently a senior at Northeastern University, where I am pursuing a degree in Economics and Data Science. This semester, I am enrolled in two data science courses and two economics courses. I am particularly excited about starting my second and final co-op next semester at Arrowstreet Capital, where I hope to further develop my skills in a professional environment.
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I am passionate about a wide range of topics including politics, history, philosophy, economics, and psychology. Outside of academics, I have a variety of hobbies. I love watching films, listening to music, traveling, skiing, playing paddle tennis, and cooking. When it comes to music, my top three genres are old-school hip-hop, R&B/soul, and jazz. Some of my favorite artists include Tupac, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, Amy Winehouse, and Mary J. Blige. As a cinephile, I watch almost everything—except horror movies. My top three films are 2001: A Space Odyssey, Mulan, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
        Originally, I’m from Georgia (the country, not the U.S. state). I came to the U.S. about three years ago for college. I love my country dearly and visit every winter and summer break. I also have two beloved cats back in Georgia, and I miss them very much.
